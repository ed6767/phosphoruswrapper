### Depreciated...
###### I am no longer working on this project and haven't for a while. This should still work but I'm not making updates.

Note:
Due to the large file size of the CEFSharp libaries, source files for the Windows wrapper are only availible on request(GitHub file limit)
All other files can be easily decompiled by using a tool like DnSpy
